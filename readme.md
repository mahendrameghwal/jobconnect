## ðŸ“… Google Meet Integration

Our app uses Google OAuth scopes strictly to create and attach Google Meet links to interview events on behalf of the signed-in user, following least-privilege principles. By default we request `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` so we can create/update a Calendar event and ask Calendar to attach a Meet conference (`conferenceData.createRequest`). This returns a Meet URL that we surface in the product. We do not access other user data beyond what is necessary for that operation. If direct Meet space management is required, we use the narrower Meet API scopes such as `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.created` (create only) or `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space` (manage), and only when those features are enabled. Users explicitly consent to scopes, tokens are stored securely, refresh tokens are requested only to maintain user-initiated functionality, and users can revoke access at any time. If scopes change in the future, users will be re-prompted for consent.

### Required scopes (choose minimal):

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events` â€” create/update events and attach Meet links (recommended minimal)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` â€” broader Calendar access (not recommended unless needed)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.created` â€” create Meet spaces (optional)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space` â€” manage Meet spaces (optional)

### Setup (server)

1. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console and set the authorized redirect URI.
2. Add the following environment variables to your server configuration:

```bash
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-server.com/api/auth/google/callback
GOOGLE_SCOPES=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events
```

3. Ensure the server has `googleapis` installed and uses OAuth2 to obtain an access token with the scopes above.
4. When creating an interview event, call the Calendar API with `conferenceData.createRequest` to receive the Meet URL.
